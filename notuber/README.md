Performance tests
- Before performance optimization, it takes about 300-350ms for the webpage to load before any performance tests are done. The file 
    sizes are 456B for index.html, 46B for style.css, and 954 for code.js
- After perfomance optimization, the webpage takes about 290-340ms to load. The file sizes are 451B for index.html,
    30B for style.css and 727B for code.js
The load times of the normal webpage and then the performance optimization page are very close in values, but 
the file sizes have a more significant difference as the sizes decrease by a noticeable amount.
1. The google map and the location of each car was implemented correctly. The only error
    is that when iterating through the jsonLocations, an error of unhandled promise rejection: type error is 
    given so a try and catch block had to be made to avoid getting an error in the console. Map was also
    not made to cover the entire screen so there would be some space for the header.
2. I did not work with anyone on this lab.
3. I spent about 4 hours on this lab, most of it was spent trying to figure out the google API.

1. The lab has been implemented correctly, all the requirements were implemented. One going beyond 
    requirment was implemented, the one with each car showing its distance from my location. There are 
    typeErrors which are caught to avoid errors in the Javascript console. The Haversine formula from 
    stackoverflow was implemented in the javascript portion of the lab.
2. I did not collaborate with anyone on the lab
3. This lab took about 4 hours.

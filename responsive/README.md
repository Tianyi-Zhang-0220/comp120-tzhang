1. The lab was implemented correctly, so as the width of the 
    web browser decreases or increases by a 100 pixels, the 
    picture shown on the web browser will change as well. The only 
    slight issure is that the picture shown on the web browser may be 
    one pixel off in width due to the width of homer.jpg being 
    333 pixels.
2. I did not collaborate or discuss the lab with anyone.
3. I spent about 3 hours completing the lab. Most of the time was 
    spent trying to find the right functions to implement in 
    css and testing to see what worked and what didn't.

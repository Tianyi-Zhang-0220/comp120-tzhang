COMP 120 Summer 2021 Private Repo for Tianyi Zhang
The purpose of this git repository is that it holds and shows the labs/homework assignments that I have completed in this Web Programming and Engineering course.
My favorite lab was the notuber one, since I learned the most on how to create a google maps api, while having to build my own server to send data to my website.

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <div id = "width">
            <article>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The product that I am looking at is something called 
                server-vuln.js, which is essentially server side code that helps create a google 
                maps api by sending the client data about a few cars in the from of JSON data.

    <h3>Methodology</h3>
        <div id = "width">
            <article>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The methodology that I used in finding these errors was by
                first looking through the code and seeing which potential errors I can find by comparing
                those described as the most common or dangerous software errors.

    <h3>Abstract of Findings</h3>
        <div id = "width">
            <article>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There were many security and privacy problems that I identfied.
                The most dangerous one being that there are two potential locations of Reflected XSS occurring,
                one in each post method. This is closely related to input validation, since user input can never
                be trusted. This then leads to how another weakness where user input is being inserted into the 
                sql database. There are also potential locations of out of bounds read and write.

    <h3>Issues</h3>
    <div id = "width">
        <ol>
            <li>The issue here is that the user inputted data is being used which could potentially cause Relected XSS.
                The location is in app.post('/rides'). The severity here is high, since the user inputted data is also being 
                inputted into the postgresql database. I found the issue by looking through post methods, since they take 
                in data, and seeing if the taken in data is used in any manner.
            </li>
            <li>The issue here is that the user inputted data is being used which could potentially cause Relected XSS.
                The location is in app.post('/update'). The severity here is high, since the user inputted data is also being 
                inputted into the postgresql database, which could potentially cause data leakage. I found the issue by looking 
                through post methods, since they take in data, and seeing if the taken in data is used in any manner.

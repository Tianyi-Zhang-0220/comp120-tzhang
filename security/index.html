    <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <div id = "width">
            <article>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The product that I am looking at is something called 
                server-vuln.js, which is essentially server side code that helps create a google 
                maps api by sending the client data about a few cars in the from of JSON data.

    <h3>Methodology</h3>
        <div id = "width">
            <article>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The methodology that I used in finding these errors was by
                first looking through the code and seeing which potential errors I can find by comparing
                those described as the most common or dangerous software errors.

    <h3>Abstract of Findings</h3>
        <div id = "width">
            <article>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There were many security and privacy problems that I identfied.
                The most dangerous one being that there are two potential locations of Reflected XSS occurring,
                one in each post method. This is closely related to input validation, since user input can never
                be trusted. This then leads to how another weakness where user input is being inserted into the 
                sql database. There are also potential locations of out of bounds read and write.

    <h3>Issues</h3>
        <div id = "width">
            <ol>
                <li>The issue here is that the user inputted data is being used which could potentially cause Relected XSS.
                    The location is in app.post('/rides'). The severity here is high, since the user inputted data is also being 
                    inputted into the postgresql database. I found the issue by looking through post methods, since they take 
                    in data, and seeing if the taken in data is used in any manner. To prevent this, you should never put untrusted
                    data into a sql database or HTML page.
                </li>
                <li>The issue here is that the user inputted data is being used which could potentially cause Relected XSS.
                    The location is in app.post('/update'). The severity here is high, since the user inputted data is also being 
                    inputted into the postgresql database, which could potentially cause data leakage. I found the issue by looking 
                    through post methods, since they take in data, and seeing if the taken in data is used in any manner. This can be 
                    prevented by not accepting unknown data nad especially not inserting it into a sql database. You can also 
                    HTML encode the data to make sure that there isn't anything suspicious.
                </li>
                <li>There is the potential issue of when inserting or accessing data of potential indices being out of bounds. The location 
                    of this issue is in app.post('/update') and app.get('/'). The severity is pretty low depending on the data in the sql 
                    database and in this case the data shouldn't be too important. I discovered the issue by reading the article CWE top 25
                    most dangerous weaknesses and realizing that if the bounds for the indices are not set specific enough, and there's the 
                    small off chance that an index could be out of bounds that then there's the chance of data being leaked. This can be prevented 
                    by just setting more specific bounds before accessing/inserting data values so that no data is leaked.
                </li>
                <li>The issue here is that there is no user authorization on who gets to access the data inside the sql databases. Since the 
                    person only needs to give a username, lat, and lng to start inserting values. The severity could potentially be high 
                    based on what data is in the sql database. This was found because I realized that when inserting or accessing data from 
                    the databases, no user authorization was needed but only that the username, lat, and lng be valid. This can be fixed by 
                    including user authentication, such that only with a certain user input can data be accessed or inserted.
                </li>
            </ol>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <div id = "width">
            <article>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Future recommendations are just to include a few more specifications in who can access the 
                data that is inserted and accessed by users. Then the more important one is to first check the username, lat, and lng 
                since those are user inputted, and user input can never be trusted.

1. Almost all aspects of the lab have been correctly implemented. Only proof of vulnerability was 
    not implemented, since I didn't know how to use the websites and that OWASP ZAP wouldn't open 
    on mac due to not being able to confirm that there is no malware.
2. I did not work on this lab with anyone.
3. I spent about 3-4 hours on this lab.
